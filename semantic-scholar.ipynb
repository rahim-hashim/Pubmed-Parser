We can remove these stop words from the text in a given corpus to clean up the data, and identify words that are more rare and potentially more relevant to what we’re interested in.\n","\n","Next, all punctuation, digits, and unncessary characters are removed.\n","\n","Lastly, each word will be lemmatized, which is defined by [Stanford's NLP group](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/stemming-and-lemmatization-1.html) as:\n","\n","> Removing inflectional endings only and to return the base or dictionary form of a word, which is known as the lemma. \n","\n","For example, in English, the verb 'to walk' may appear as 'walk', 'walked', 'walks' or 'walking'. The base form, 'walk', that one might look up in a dictionary, is called the lemma for the word. \n","\n","This program uses [WordNet](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/) which is a large, freely and publicly available lexical database for the English language.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":31,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["[nltk_data] Downloading package punkt to\n","[nltk_data]     /Users/rahimhashim/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Package punkt is already up-to-date!\n","[nltk_data] Downloading package stopwords to\n","[nltk_data]     /Users/rahimhashim/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Package stopwords is already up-to-date!\n","[nltk_data] Downloading package wordnet to\n","[nltk_data]     /Users/rahimhashim/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Package wordnet is already up-to-date!\n","[nltk_data] Downloading package omw to /Users/rahimhashim/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Package omw is already up-to-date!\n"]},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Stefano Fusi ['neuron', 'memory', 'neural', 'model', 'synaptic', 'task', 'learning', 'activity', 'network', 'number', 'time', 'synapsis', 'response', 'state', 'representation', 'selectivity', 'show', 'input', 'variable', 'reconstruction']\n","Daniel Salzman ['stimulus', 'amygdala', 'neural', 'neuron', 'aversive', 'reward', 'information', 'value', 'response', 'spatial', 'learning', 'brain', 'process', 'attention', 'different', 'ofc', 'state', 'monkey', 'representation', 'sensory']\n"]}],"source":["from helper.wordCount import lemming_count\n","lemming_count(searchesHash, top_n_words=20)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"jOTRzX9ErqBw"},"source":["***\n","### Year-by-Year Analysis\n","\n","The first analysis we'll be performing is year-by-year lexicon frequency.
