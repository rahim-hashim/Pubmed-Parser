words in each query.\n","\n","First, remove all the stop words from the abstracts. As defined by the [nltk documentation](https://pythonspot.com/nltk-stop-words/):\n","\n",">Stop words are common words like ‘the’, ‘and’, ‘I’, etc. that are very frequent in text, and so don’t convey insights into the specific topic of a document. We can remove these stop words from the text in a given corpus to clean up the data, and identify words that are more rare and potentially more relevant to what we’re interested in.\n","\n","Next, all punctuation, digits, and unncessary characters are removed.\n","\n","Lastly, each word will be lemmatized, which is defined by [Stanford's NLP group](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/stemming-and-lemmatization-1.html) as:\n","\n","> Removing inflectional endings only and to return the base or dictionary form of a word, which is known as the lemma. \n","\n","For example, in English, the verb 'to walk' may appear as 'walk', 'walked', 'walks' or 'walking'.
